Fractional Knapsack Problem Using Greedy Algorithm
1. Aim
To design and implement the Fractional Knapsack Problem using the Greedy Algorithm in C++ to maximize the total profit within a given knapsack capacity.

2. Problem Statement
The Fractional Knapsack Problem is an optimization problem in which a set of items is given. Each item has a specific weight and profit, and the knapsack has a limited capacity.

The objective is to select items in such a way that the maximum possible profit is obtained without exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.

Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, the Fractional Knapsack Problem allows us to take a fraction of an item.

The selection of items is based on the Profit/Weight ratio.

3. Objective
The objectives of this project are:

To understand the Greedy Algorithm.
To implement the Fractional Knapsack Problem in C++.
To calculate the Profit/Weight ratio of each item.
To sort items according to their Profit/Weight ratio.
To select items with the highest ratio first.
To allow fractional selection of an item.
To maximize the total profit.
To analyze the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
4. Algorithm Used
Greedy Algorithm
The Fractional Knapsack Problem is solved using a Greedy approach.

For each item, the following ratio is calculated:

Profit/Weight Ratio = Profit / Weight
The items are then sorted in descending order of Profit/Weight ratio.

The item with the highest ratio is selected first because it provides the maximum profit for every unit of weight.

If the complete item cannot fit into the remaining capacity, a fraction of that item is selected.

5. Working of the Algorithm
The algorithm follows these steps:

Read the number of items.
Read the weight and profit of every item.
Calculate the Profit/Weight ratio.
Sort all items in descending order of their ratio.
Initialize the remaining knapsack capacity.
Select items one by one.
If the complete item fits into the remaining capacity, take the complete item.
If the complete item does not fit, take the required fraction of the item.
Calculate the weight taken and profit obtained.
Continue until the knapsack becomes full.
Display the selected items and maximum profit.
6. Pseudocode
FRACTIONAL_KNAPSACK(items, capacity)

    FOR each item
        ratio = item.profit / item.weight

    SORT items in descending order of ratio

    totalProfit = 0
    remainingCapacity = capacity

    FOR each item

        IF remainingCapacity == 0
            BREAK

        IF item.weight <= remainingCapacity

            Take complete item

            fraction = 1

            weightTaken = item.weight

            profitTaken = item.profit

            remainingCapacity =
                remainingCapacity - item.weight

            totalProfit =
                totalProfit + item.profit

        ELSE

            fraction =
                remainingCapacity / item.weight

            weightTaken =
                remainingCapacity

            profitTaken =
                item.profit * fraction

            totalProfit =
                totalProfit + profitTaken

            remainingCapacity = 0

    RETURN totalProfit
7. Example
Consider the following items:

Item	Weight	Profit	Profit/Weight Ratio
1	10	60	6.00
2	20	100	5.00
3	30	120	4.00
Knapsack Capacity
50
8. Calculate Profit/Weight Ratio
For each item:

Item 1:
60 / 10 = 6.00

Item 2:
100 / 20 = 5.00

Item 3:
120 / 30 = 4.00
Therefore, the items are arranged as:

Item 1 → Ratio = 6.00
Item 2 → Ratio = 5.00
Item 3 → Ratio = 4.00
9. Item Selection Process
Item 1
Weight = 10

Profit = 60

The complete item fits into the knapsack.

Weight Taken = 10
Profit Gained = 60
Remaining Capacity = 50 - 10 = 40
Item 2
Weight = 20

Profit = 100

The complete item fits into the remaining capacity.

Weight Taken = 20
Profit Gained = 100
Remaining Capacity = 40 - 20 = 20
Item 3
Weight = 30

Profit = 120

Only 20 units of capacity remain, so the complete item cannot be taken.

Fraction taken:

Fraction = Remaining Capacity / Item Weight
         = 20 / 30
         = 0.667
         = 66.67%
Profit obtained:

Profit = 120 × (20 / 30)
       = 80
Therefore:

Weight Taken = 20
Profit Gained = 80
10. Final Selection
Item	Fraction Taken	Weight Taken	Profit Taken
1	1.00	10	60
2	1.00	20	100
3	0.67	20	80
Total Weight
10 + 20 + 20 = 50
Maximum Profit
60 + 100 + 80 = 240
Therefore:

Maximum Profit = 240
11. Time Complexity Analysis
Suppose there are n items.

Calculating Profit/Weight Ratio
The ratio is calculated once for each item:

O(n)
Sorting
The items are sorted according to the Profit/Weight ratio:

O(n log n)
Selecting Items
The sorted items are traversed once:

O(n)
Therefore:

O(n) + O(n log n) + O(n)
The sorting operation dominates the overall complexity.

Overall Time Complexity
O(n log n)
12. Space Complexity
The item information is stored using an array or vector.

Therefore:

Space Complexity = O(n)
Additional variables such as capacity, fraction, total profit, and weight taken require:

O(1)
The overall space complexity for the implementation is:

O(n)
13. Comparison with 0/1 Knapsack
Feature	Fractional Knapsack	0/1 Knapsack
Items can be divided	Yes	No
Fraction of item allowed	Yes	No
Common approach	Greedy	Dynamic Programming
Greedy gives optimal solution	Yes	No
Time Complexity	O(n log n)	O(n × W) using DP
Selection method	Profit/Weight ratio	Optimal combination
The main difference is that Fractional Knapsack allows an item to be divided, while 0/1 Knapsack allows only two choices: take the complete item or do not take it.

23. Conclusion
The Fractional Knapsack Problem was successfully implemented in C++ using the Greedy Algorithm.

The algorithm calculates the Profit/Weight ratio of every item and sorts the items in descending order of this ratio. Items with the highest profit per unit of weight are selected first. If an item cannot completely fit into the remaining capacity, the required fraction of that item is selected.

The algorithm achieves an overall time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting and requires O(n) space for storing the item information.

This project demonstrates the practical application of the Greedy Algorithm to an optimization problem and shows how selecting the locally best option can produce the optimal solution when fractional selection is allowed.
